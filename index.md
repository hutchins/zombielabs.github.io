We're a Greater Boston based venture delivering free software, awesome innovation and wonky projects. We're good at taking an idea or concept and turning it into a production ready product.

## Why the name?

Our team shares a lot in common with zombies. We don't sleep much, we never stop working towards our goals, we love our snacks; most importantly, all our ideas are powered by brains. Real humans, real thought, real work. Luckily we don't share similar hygiene habits with zombies.

## What do you do?

We build services. We're a team of highly skilled, extremely capable computer software engineers. We can build web sites, web services, mobile applications, games, desktop apps &mdash; we specialize in high demand, realtime, highly sensitive, high security, user-privacy centric, algorithm-driven, advanced database powered services. Basically, we're good at building tough things. Our team isn't like average programmers, we're specialists and experts.

## What have you built?

Top secret. Most of our entire team has U.S. Secret clearance and are certified security experts.
